  openwb_enabled:
    name: Enable openWB Integration
    description: >-
      Enable or disable data forwarding to openWB (Open Wallbox) for EV charging control.
      When enabled, meter data will be sent to a second MQTT broker used by your openWB wallbox.
      This allows openWB to use your electricity meter for phase-based load management.

  openwb_mqtt_host:
    name: openWB MQTT Broker Host
    description: >-

    name: openWB MQTT Broker Port
    description: >-
      Port number of your openWB MQTT broker.

      Device ID for the counter module in openWB.
      This number is used in the MQTT topics: openWB/set/mqtt/counter/{device_id}/get/...
      Default: 8 (standard MQTT module counter).
      Check your openWB configuration if you're using a different ID.

  meter_name:
    name: Meter Name
    description: >-
      Friendly name for your electricity meter.
      Used as device name in Home Assistant.
      Sensor names will appear as: {meter_name} Power Total, {meter_name} Voltage L1, etc.
      Use descriptive names like 'MainMeter', 'HouseMeter', or 'easyMeter'.

  poll_interval:
    name: Poll Interval
    description: >-
      How often to read data from the meter (in seconds).
      Recommended: 2 seconds for real-time monitoring.
      Higher values (10-60 seconds) reduce network traffic but may miss power spikes.
      Energy Dashboard accuracy is not affected by polling interval.

  log_level:
    name: Log Level
